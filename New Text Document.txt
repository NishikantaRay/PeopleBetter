where to add this code in html file
The placement of schema markup code within an HTML file can vary depending on the specific use case. However, here are some general guidelines:

For schema markup that applies to the entire page (e.g., a website or organization), it should be placed in the <head> section of the HTML file.

For schema markup that applies to a specific section of the page (e.g., a product or article), it should be placed within the relevant HTML tag(s) for that section. For example, for an article schema markup, you could place the code within the <article> tag.

For schema markup that applies to multiple sections of the page (e.g., breadcrumbs), it can be placed within a separate HTML tag, such as a <div> or <nav> tag, and then placed within the relevant section(s) of the page.

It's important to note that schema markup code should be placed within <script type="application/ld+json"> tags, as shown in the examples I provided earlier. This ensures that the code is recognized as schema markup by search engines and other applications that consume structured data.

In any case, it's a good practice to test your schema markup using Google's Structured Data Testing Tool to ensure that it is being recognized correctly.

for breadcombs where we will add
For breadcrumbs, you would typically add the schema markup code to the HTML section where the breadcrumbs appear on your website. You can wrap the breadcrumbs code within a <nav> or <div> tag with the itemscope and itemtype attributes set to https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList.

Here's an example of how you could add the breadcrumbs schema markup code to a product page:

html
Copy code
<div itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList">
  <nav aria-label="breadcrumb">
    <ol class="breadcrumb">
      <li class="breadcrumb-item" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <a itemprop="item" href="https://www.example.com/home">
          <span itemprop="name">Home</span></a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="1">
      </li>
      <li class="breadcrumb-item" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <a itemprop="item" href="https://www.example.com/category1">
          <span itemprop="name">Category 1</span></a>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="2">
      </li>
      <li class="breadcrumb-item active" itemprop="itemListElement" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/ListItem">
        <span itemprop="name">Product 1</span>
        <meta itemprop="position" content="3">
      </li>
    </ol>
  </nav>
</div>
In this example, the breadcrumbs appear within a navigation element with the aria-label attribute set to "breadcrumb" for accessibility. The breadcrumbs are wrapped within a <div> tag with the itemscope and itemtype attributes set to https://schema.org/BreadcrumbList, and each breadcrumb item is wrapped within a <li> tag with the itemprop, itemscope, and itemtype attributes set to itemListElement, https://schema.org/ListItem, respectively. The meta tags are used to indicate the position of each breadcrumb item in the breadcrumb list.

how to hide this section
If you want to hide the section that contains the schema markup, you can use CSS to do so. Here's an example of how you can hide it:

html
Copy code
<style>
  .hidden {
    display: none;
  }
</style>

<div class="hidden" itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/JobPosting">
  <!-- your schema markup here -->
</div>
In this example, we've added a CSS class called hidden to the div element that contains the schema markup. We've then added some CSS that sets the display property to none for any elements with the hidden class. This will effectively hide the entire section from view.

Note that while this will hide the section from the user, it won't actually remove the schema markup from the page. It's still there, and search engines and other bots will still be able to see it. If you want to remove the schema markup entirely, you'll need to edit the HTML code directly.

but it is not showing when i search in google
It's important to keep in mind that just because you've added schema markup to your website, it doesn't guarantee that Google will display rich snippets in search results. Google uses a variety of factors to determine which sites get rich snippets, including the quality and relevance of the content, the popularity of the site, and the accuracy of the schema markup.

To increase the chances of your schema markup appearing in Google search results, you can take the following steps:

Make sure your schema markup is valid and free of errors. You can use Google's Structured Data Testing Tool to check your markup for errors.

Ensure that your website has a clear and well-organized structure that is easy for Google to understand.

Create high-quality, relevant content that provides value to your audience.

Build high-quality backlinks to your website from other authoritative sites.

Encourage social media sharing and engagement to increase the popularity of your site.

By following these steps, you can increase the likelihood that Google will display rich snippets for your website in search results. However, it's important to remember that there is no guarantee that your schema markup will always appear in search results, as it ultimately depends on a variety of factors beyond your control.
